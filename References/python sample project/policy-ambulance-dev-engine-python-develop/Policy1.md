A claim for each client must be billed with the transport procedure code and the mileage procedure code with the GM modifier that indicates multiple client transport.


Claims must include the names and Medicaid numbers of other Texas Medicaid clients who shared the transfer, or indicate “Not a Medicaid client” in Block 19 of the CMS 1500 paper form.

```
If GM modifier, then Block 19 should contain list of names
```

TMHP adjusts the payment to 80 percent of the allowable base rate for each claim and divides mileage equally among the clients who share the ambulance

```
If GM modifier, then payment = 80% of the allowable base rate; mileage = mileage/(number of names)
```
